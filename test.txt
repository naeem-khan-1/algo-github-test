Python: 3.6+
Testing Env: Pytest


Objective:
    1. Rewrite the main function to use an object that returns all the proper data to the output. 
    2. The function should also return the bad data that was ignored or not added to the commands. A bad data is any entry in json which either does not contain a function key,
       or the function value does not contain the proper data read in step 1.
    3. Then prepare TDD test cases for each function you create using pytest.


Submission:
    Please upload to your public GitHub with a repository name of algo-github-test and submit the link for review.


Rewrite Expectations:
    Use Python hinting to define functions
    Use list comprehension to simplify the loops


Testing Expectations:
    Show use of parametrized test cases.
    Test inputs to functions for None, Dict, Int, String, Tuple
    Show tests for positive cases
    Use setup to default variables
    Each function test should be in its own file
    There should be a mock of the function `random.sample(data, 2)` as part of your output
